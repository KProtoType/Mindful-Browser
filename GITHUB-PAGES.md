## How GitHub Pages Works

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows repositories to serve HTML content directly from the repository. When enabled:

1. The content of your repository becomes accessible at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`
2. The `index.html` file in the root directory becomes the homepage
3. Other HTML files are accessible at their relative paths

1. Go to the repository settings (click "Settings" tab at the top of the repository page)
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section

It may take a few minutes for the site to become available after enabling GitHub Pages.
