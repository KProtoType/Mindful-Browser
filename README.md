## üåü What is Mindful Browser?

Think of Mindful Browser as a friendly pause button for your web browsing. When you try to visit distracting websites (like social media), it gives you a 1-minute delay - a moment to ask yourself:

- Do I really need to visit this site right now?
- Is this the best use of my time?
- Am I browsing mindfully or just out of habit?

## üí≠ Why Use Mindful Browser?

It's like adding a waiting period before making an impulse purchase - often just that little pause is enough to make us reconsider!
