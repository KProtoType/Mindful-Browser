# üßò Mindful Browser

A simple Chrome extension that promotes mindfulness by adding a 1-minute pause before loading potentially distracting websites.

## ü§î What Does This Extension Do?

Mindful Browser acts like a friendly pause button for your web browsing habits:

- When you try to visit distracting websites (like social media), it gives you a 1-minute delay
- During this minute, you have time to ask: "Do I really need to visit this site right now?"
- It helps break the habit of mindlessly visiting time-consuming websites

## üôè Why Practice Mindful Browsing?

Think of Mindful Browser like a speed bump for the internet. Many of us reflexively type social media URLs dozens of times per day without thinking. This extension helps you be more intentional about where you spend your online time and attention.

Just that small 1-minute pause is often enough to make you realize: "I don't actually need to check this right now."
